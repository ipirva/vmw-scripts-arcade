The\ncombination of transport zones plus transport connectors enables NSX to\nform tunnels between hypervisors. Transport zones define which interfaces\non the hypervisors can communicate with which other interfaces on other\nhypervisors to establish overlay tunnels or provide connectivity to a VLAN.\nA logical switch can be in one (and only one) transport zone. This means\nthat all of a switch's interfaces must be in the same transport zone.\nHowever, each hypervisor virtual switch (OVS or VDS) has multiple\ninterfaces (connectors), and each connector can be attached to a different\nlogical switch. For example, on a single hypervisor with two connectors,\nconnector A can be attached to logical switch 1 in transport zone A, while\nconnector B is attached to logical switch 2 in transport zone B. In this\nway, a single hypervisor can participate in multiple transport zones. The\nAPI for creating a transport zone requires that a single host switch be\nspecified for each transport zone, and multiple transport zones can share\nthe same host

For a hypervisor host, this means that it hosts\nVMs that will communicate over NSX-T logical switches. For NSX Edges,\nthis means that it will have logical router uplinks and downlinks.\n\nThis API creates transport node for a host node (hypervisor) or edge node\n(router) in the transport network.\n\nWhen you run this command for a host, NSX Manager attempts to install the\nNSX kernel modules, which are packaged as VIB, RPM, or DEB files. For the\ninstallation to succeed, you must provide the host login credentials and the\nhost thumbprint.\n\nTo get the ESXi host thumbprint, SSH to the host and run the\n<b>openssl x509 -in /etc/vmware/ssl/rui.crt -fingerprint -sha256 -noout</b>\ncommand.\n\nTo generate host key thumbprint using SHA-256 algorithm please follow the\nsteps below.\n\nLog into the host, making sure that the connection is not vulnerable to a\nman in the middle attack. Check whether a public key already exists.\nHost public key is generally located at '/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub'.\nIf the key is not present then generate a new key by running the following\ncommand and follow the instructions.\n\n<b>ssh-keygen -t rsa</b>\n\nNow generate a SHA256 hash of the key using the following command. Please\nmake sure to pass the appropriate file name if the public key is stored with\na different file name other than the default 'id_rsa.pub'.\n\n<b>awk '{print $2}' id_rsa.pub | base64 -d | sha256sum -b | sed 's/ .*$//' | xxd -r -p | base64</b>\nThis api is deprecated as part of FN+TN unification. Please use Transport Node API\nto install NSX components on a node.\n\nAdditional documentation on creating a transport node can be found\nin the NSX-T Installation Guide.\n\nIn order for the transport node to forward packets,\nthe host_switch_spec property must be specified.\n\nHost switches (called bridges in OVS on KVM hypervisors) are the\nindividual switches within the host virtual switch. Virtual machines\nare connected to the host switches.\n\nWhen creating a transport node, you need to specify if the host switches\nare already manually preconfigured on the node, or if NSX should create\nand manage the host switches. You specify this choice by the type\nof host switches you pass in the host_switch_spec property of the\nTransportNode request payload.\n\nFor a KVM host, you can preconfigure the host switch, or you can have\nNSX Manager perform the configuration. For an ESXi host or NSX Edge\nnode, NSX Manager always configures the host switch.\n\nTo preconfigure the host switches on a KVM host, pass an array\nof PreconfiguredHostSwitchSpec objects that describes those host\nswitches. In the current NSX-T release, only one prefonfigured host\nswitch can be specified.  See the PreconfiguredHostSwitchSpec schema\ndefinition for documentation on the properties that must be provided.\nPreconfigured host switches are only supported on KVM hosts, not on\nESXi hosts or NSX Edge nodes.\n\nTo allow NSX to manage the host switch configuration on KVM hosts,\nESXi hosts, or NSX Edge nodes, pass an array of StandardHostSwitchSpec\nobjects in the host_switch_spec property, and NSX will automatically\ncreate host switches with the properties you provide. In the current\nNSX-T release, up to 16 host switches can be automatically managed.\nSee the StandardHostSwitchSpec schema definition for documentation on\nthe properties that must be provided.\n\nNote: Previous versions of NSX-T also used a property named\ntransport_zone_endpoints at TransportNode level. This property is\ndeprecated which creates some combinations of new client along with\nold client payloads. Examples [1] & [2] show old/existing client\nrequest and response by populating transport_zone_endpoints property\nat TransportNode level. Example [3] shows TransportNode creation\nrequest/response by populating transport_zone_endpoints property\nat StandardHostSwitch level and other new properties.\n\nThe request should either provide node_deployement_info or node_id.\n\nIf the host node (hypervisor) or edge node (router) is already added in\nsystem then it can be converted to transport node by providing node_id in\nrequest.\n\nIf host node (hypervisor) or edge node (router) is not already present in\nsystem then information should be provided under node_deployment_info.\n","parameters":[{"schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/TransportNode"},"required":true,"name":"TransportNode","in":"body"}],"produces":["application/json"],"tags":["System Administration, Configuration, Fabric, Nodes, Transport Nodes"],"summary":"Create a Transport Node","x-vmw-nsx-module":"TransportNodeLcm","consumes":["application/json"],"operationId":"CreateTransportNodeWithDeploymentInfo"},"get":{"responses":{"200":{"description":"OK","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/TransportNodeListResult"}},"404":{"$ref":"#/responses/NotFound"},"403":{"$ref":"#/responses/Forbidden"},"412":{"$ref":"#/responses/PreconditionFailed"},"400":{"$ref":"#/responses/BadRequest"},"503":{"$ref":"#/responses/ServiceUnavailable"},"500":{"$ref":"#/responses/InternalServerError"}},"description":"Returns information about all transport nodes along with underlying host or\nedge details.

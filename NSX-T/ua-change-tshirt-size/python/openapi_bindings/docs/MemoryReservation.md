## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**reservation_percentage** | **int** | Memory reserved relative to the default reservation of 100 percent. For example, take an edge virtual machine of medium form factor. By default, an edge of medium form factor is configured with 8 GB of memory and with reservation of 100 percent. So, 8 GB of memory is reserved. If you specify reservation_percentage value as 50 percent, then 4 GB of memory will be reserved.  | [optional] [default to 100]
